Given a lowercase string of letters that Farmer Nhoj has heard Mildred say, compute the minimum number of times Mildred must have hummed the entire cowphabet in order for Farmer Nhoj to have heard the given string. Farmer Nhoj isn't always paying attention to what Mildred hums, and so he might have missed some of the letters that Mildred has hummed."

As we know, the zodiac animals for Chinese calendar years follow a 12-year cycle: Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, Pig, Rat, and then Ox again. Slightly lesser known is the fact that a mysterious time portal opens up during every year of the Ox, allowing cows to travel through time to any other year of the Ox in the past or future. Bessie the cow would like to take advantage of the time portal that has opened up this year to visit N of her famous bovine ancestors who lived long ago in history.Bessie does not need to use the time portal in a given Ox year if she does not want to. Time portals connect the first days of each Ox year with each-other, so for example if Bessie travels to a time portal and then waits 12 years for the next time portal, she spends exactly 12 years in the process. Bessie starts her adventure on the first day of the present Ox year, so she can travel back in time right away. None of Bessie's ancestors live in Ox years."
